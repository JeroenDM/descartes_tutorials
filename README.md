# descartes_tutorials

## Introduction
In this fork of the descartes_tutorials repo, we are working on a second tutorial.
This tutorial will discuss: adding collision objects, visualizing trajectory points and why a planned path can still contain collisions.

## Installation

I assume you have installed [ros indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo).
Unfortunately this package cannot be installed just using apt-get.

First, if you don't have a catkin workspace, you can create one:

[...]

Then, some of the packages are not realeased yet and have to be installed from source. If you don't have a github account, create a github account. (You can also download zip files, but ...)

## How to launch?

We added two new launch files, "kuka_sim.launc" and "tutorial2.launch".
The first will launch the robot model in rviz for this tutorial.
The second will execute the tutorial source code.
