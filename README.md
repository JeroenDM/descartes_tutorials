# descartes_tutorials

## Introduction
In this fork of the descartes_tutorials repo, we are working on a second tutorial.
This tutorial will discuss: adding collision objects, visualizing trajectory points and why a planned path can still contain collisions.

## Installation

We still have to fix dependency issues, so installing can be difficult.
Our current approach is to add all packages listed [here](https://github.com/JeroenDM/descartes_tutorials/blob/f692aeea18ae43eb451e67d006aca0808fefbf1f/worspace_structure.md) to your [workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace).

## How to launch?

We added two new launch files, "kuka_sim.launc" and "tutorial2.launch".
The first will launch the robot model in rviz for this tutorial.
The second will execute the tutorial source code.
